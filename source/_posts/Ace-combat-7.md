Platform：PS4 Pro｜Version：Common Edition + Season Pass｜Milk Rate：7/10

### Summary

1. Definitly need season pass or just Deluxe edition for better experience
2. PS4 Plus is required for Multiplayer on PS4
3. Manipulation is very great.



I've heard ace combat for a very long time, so I went to buy a disc. I stuck at Misson 7 for my poor performance fighter and weapon. However, I don't want to put more effort in playing previous Mission for more MRP (The currency in game) to unlock better equipments, so I bought the season pass. It contains the best planes (ADF-series) and extra missions. While ADF is so good, it uses laser for gun while others use bullet. Also QAMM (dramatically increase hit rate) vs common missiles.

Plot: It's bit of stream of consciousness, reminded me of EVA, makes me wonder if their fundings are that tight. But the conversation in games is really good. I don't pay to much attention to what those characters said since I was busy chasing other fighters or attempt to aim ground targets.

Video quality: The model of fighters are super detailed, also the cockpit. You should try cockpit view, very impressive. I heard people with PS VR said how realistic it is to control the plane with VR. The ground details are quite bad, but you won't look at the ground all the time. Here I recommend the *Microsoft Simulator 2020*, the trailor on E3 2019 is crazy.

Control：I've played *H.A.W.K.*, the design of mission and the control are quite alike. You need to learn some tricks from youtubers if you want to have a better fight. Season pass is needed especially you only want to experience the plot. Without season pass, it's way too difficult even for Easy mode, unless you are really good at this. The last mission almost made me cry, it made me fly the fighter through a tiny tunnel? HOW DARE YOU!
