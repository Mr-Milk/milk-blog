I was jogging this evening, an idea just struck my head. Why can't we do all the boring and time consuming experiments on the cloud, all those poor Ph.D. and technicists could spend more time thinking about what to do instead of exhaust themselves on getting experiments done. And this also solve the serious replicated problems in today's acedemic industry.

So, I did a few research. There are already some companies out there (Well, Idea is cheap). Here is a list to look into if you are interested.

- [Synthego](https://www.synthego.com/): This company claim to delivery any kind of gene-editing micro-organism
- [Transcriptic](https://www.transcriptic.com/technology/): Seem to be a successful company with certain scale, automated experiements
- [Pantabio](https://pantabio.com/cloud-lab): This company allow you to send sample and conduct pre-programmed automatic experiments
- [Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/): Allow you to build your own robotic lab with low price

I wonder how cloud experiments will change the way of doing research in the future. Picture this, you have an idea on studying something, without walking out of your office and walk into your lab. You could just plan everything in a program and let it run by itself, all the experiments are done in the cloud and you received all the results by email. Then you can conduct the data analysis, write an article and publish it. You can even publish your paper without getting your ass off your chair. The development of AI and Robotics technology will definately replace most of the boring works in today's lab. And the 5G might even allow us to control the robortic arm to do the experiments through screen.

While doing eveything in cloud without getting your hand dirty is too perfect to image, the cost of such cloud experiments is also unaffordable to many labs. And I think this is the main issue why people don't even consider using the services. Of course there are other issues like transfering samples between experiment centers and privacy issues. But before it's price become acceptable to most of the people, other issues are just nothing than a concern.
