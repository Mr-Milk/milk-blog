I heard a lecture given by someone who works for nature publish group. She talked about some very useful tips on writing and publishing, so I want to write it down.

Always remember, your first reader is your boss, then the editor and the reviewer.

## Logical Manuscript Structure 

### Introduction

1. Give some general background for readers to understand your work. Noticed that the readers might not be familiar with your research field. From the Background, talk about your focus in this work.

2. About citations: 
   - Citations should be globally, eg. From USA, Europe, Asia... 
   - As up-to-date as possible 

3. Why your work is important? Your Motivation?

   It's often seen sentences like this “Because no one has done it, so I did it" to illustrate their motivation. NO!!! It could be no sense or too hard for people to look into this part. 

   You should gibe a reasonable motivation like how your work contributes to this field or further.

### Methods 

1. This part is for reproduce purpose and for reviewer to evaluate if the experiment design is reasonable.

2. It's possible to be rejected because of high similarity in Methods part. Please add citations to avoid severe similarity. DON'T copy and paste, even it's your previous work.

### Results 

1. What to write?

   Observation of phenomena

   - The characteristics of your observation
   - Summarize your conclusions from above 

2. Figures
   - Determinate your main figures and sup figures
   - Organize your structure according to the order of figures 



### Discussion 

- How to contribute to the field 
- Summarize your work 
- Interpret your findings
- If your findings have some issues, say it out, but say it’s unrelated to this work and can be dived in more in future research 



## Title 

1. What to include?
   - What’s importance
   - Keywords for indexing (easy to be searched) 
   - < 20 words, more about conclusions 

2. What to Avoid?
   - Question style title (Just not recommended, nature did a research shows this style of title is related to lower citation)
   - Methods (Only if it's unique)
   - Abbreviation



## Abstract 

- Importance of the topic 
- Significance of your study 
- Relevance of your study 
- Use data to illustrate your importance, but not beautiful words 



## Peer review 

- Reviewer has limited time 
- Cover letter is important for “nature” submission 
- - Title + Article type 
  - Brief background + Research aim (Notice the editor might not in your field, so the background should give a general intro but concise) 
  - Study design + Findings 
  - Why suitable for this journal? Conclusions + interest to the readership (How to promote the field research) 
  - Additional information: Include reviewer, younger and active research 



## Response letter 

- Clearly sate the revision problems + how to revisions, refer to page and line number
- Don’t be aggressive, be objective

## Tips for Nature Journal

- Consider all “Nature” journals as general journals, not professional 
- Cover letter is important for “Nature” submission 

Hope everyone can publish their work on _Nature_ one day!
